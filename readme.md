## Coding Style

Voten follows the PSR-2 coding standard and the PSR-4 autoloading standard. Voten also uses [StyleCI](https://styleci.io) for automatically merging any style fixes. So you don't have to worry about your code style much.

## Software Stack

Voten is a Laravel application that runs on the following software:

- Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
- Nginx 1.10+
- MySQL 5.7+ (to use mariaDB, you must modify `json` type migration columns to `text`)
- PHP 7.1+
- Redis 3.0+
- Git 2.8.4+
- [Pusher](https://pusher.com/)

To install all the required stack on a server, we recommend an auto-installation service such as [CodePier](https://codepier.io/?ref=voten).

## Installation Steps

```

Open ".env" file with your desired editor and enter your services info.
Now run below commands:
