			How We Use Information About You
		</h2>

		<p>
			Different websites collect their users' information for different reasons. We collect information in order to:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Send our users updates, alerts, support or private messages.
			</li>

			<li>
				Provide our users with our services.
			</li>

			<li>
				Maintain and improve our services.
			</li>

			<li>
				Analyze and supervise the data usage, trends and activities.
			</li>

			<li>
				Communicate with our users about topics we think that could be interesting to them.
			</li>

			<li>
				Provide our users with advertisements and services which could math their interests.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		<h2 class="title">
			How We Share Information
		</h2>

		<p>
			Unlike other social websites sharing your information with third parties for many reasons, {{ config('app.name') }} is conservative about keeping your information secret. We might connect with third parties in the future but we will never share your information with them.
		</p>

		<br>
		<h2 class="title">
			Children under 13
		</h2>

		<p>
			We do not think contents on websites like ours, are intended for individuals under 13. Therefore, if you are under 13, you are not allowed to make an account or use our services.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is possible that we change some of our policies over time. Please note that, if you continue to use our services after we have changed our policies, it will mean your consent to our new policy.
